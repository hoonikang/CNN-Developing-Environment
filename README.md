CNN Developing Environment or ToolKit

I make Convolutional Neural Network Library to help people who want to develop something using CNN.
I never use any additional library while implement CNN Library using C++ Purely.
For example dataset, MNIST is in Folder and you decompress each .egg file and move in sources' directory.
You can adjust Stride, pad, pool, channel(Factor name is RGB), learning rate, batch_size, 
classfication number, filter size,  image width&height.
And you can adjust CNN's Depth changing the self_hidden_num & each layer's number changing the self_hidden_list.
Good Luck!
